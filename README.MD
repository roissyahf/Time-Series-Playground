## Welcome to my Time Series Exploration Laboratory! 

This repository documents my journey exploring various techniques and models for tackling time series problems. Here, you'll find my experiments, thoughts, and results laid out in a transparent manner.

**What you'll find:**

* **Jupyter Notebooks:** Each notebook dives into a specific experiment, covering data exploration, model training, evaluation, and insights.
* **README.md files:** Each notebook is accompanied by a README.md file providing context, objectives, key findings, and any relevant details.
* **Data:** Raw data files used in the experiments are stored in the `dataset` directory.
* **README.md:** This file serves as a central introduction to the project, outlining the overall problem, key experiments, and any additional information.

**Feel free to:**

* Clone the repository and explore the notebooks.
* Run the experiments yourself and compare your results.
* Fork the repository and build upon my work.
* Open issues or pull requests to share your insights and contribute to the project.

**Let's dive into the exciting world of time series!**
